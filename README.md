My first attempt at writing a simple API. Uses Flask and Python, the example is a list of books in dict format which is converted to .json using jsonify. The API accepts retreival ('GET) and adding new books ('POST') and automatically assigns a new id number for each new entry.

Tested with Firefox and Postman on Windows.

**Time taken to completion: ~5 minutes**
